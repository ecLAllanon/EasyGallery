****** How it works? ******

You just copy this app's files on a server with Php enabled. In a subfolder called /photos/, you can put files & sub-folders.
It'll list all pictures files as a gallery powered by Galleria, and sub-folders with thumbnails.


****** Setup ******

Put the app in root directory.
Put pictures & sub-folders (to create galleries) in /photos/
Avoid special chars in names of subdirectories & files (spaces are ok, as accents).


****** What format are supported? ******

Only pictures are accepted, .jpg, .jpeg, .png or .gif files.


****** Set a custom thumbnail ******

It'll first search subfolders for a file named thumbnail.jpg. If not found, it'll use the first picture.
If no picture is found, it'll not display the folder.


****** License ******

Not sure I've one.
