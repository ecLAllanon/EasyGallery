****** How it works? ******

You just copy this app's files on a server with Php enabled. In /photo/ folder, you can put files & sub-folders.
It'll list all pictures files (.jpg or .jpeg only) as a gallery powered by Galleria, and sub-folders with thumbnails.

****** Setup ******

Put the app in root directory.
Put pictures & sub-folders (to create galleries) in /photos/
Avoid special chars in names of subdirectories & files

****** What format are supported? ******

Only pictures are accepted, .jpg, .jpeg, .png or .gif files.

****** Set a custom thumbnail ******

It'll first search subfolders for a file named thumbnail.jpg. If not found, it'll use the first picture.
